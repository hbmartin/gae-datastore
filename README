Want to use just the datastore from the AppEngine stack? This will give you a web hash-value gateway to the datastore.

h2. Really **simple** to use!

To **store** a value, just post it to /put/_key_ as the _value_ parameter.
* The key is optional, a random one will be generated for you if missing (you'll get it back in the answer).
* Due AppEngine datastore limitations, the key must start with a letter. 
* Alternatively, post the key in a _key_ Post parameter. If you do both (key in URL and Post), the URL takes precedence.
* If the key already exists, the value will be updated.

To **fetch** a value, just make a Get request to /get/_key_

h2. Just a key-value store ?

Yes, but a fast and scalable one. As scalable as App Engine.

h2. Roadmap

* True JSON support including GQL queries and aggregates would be nice.
* Somehow expose all datastore functionality through a Rest interface.
